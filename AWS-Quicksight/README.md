# AWS Quicksight
QuickSight is a part of Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables businesses to upgrade from a spreadsheet based reporting to a sophisticated, interactive tool that can analyze data. 



## Advantages of AWS Quicksight over other BI tools

#### 1. Great Data Compatibility
AWS Quicksight has great support for different data sources  like S3, RDS, Aurora, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis, etc.. It can access data from almost any data source present on the internet and even from a CSV file (comma separated file). 

#### 2. High-Performance SPICE Engine
SPICE is Amazon Quicksight’s super-fast, parallel, in-memory calculation engine. With SPICE, you can fetch your data super fast and perform some highly complex and advanced calculations very fast.

#### 3. Great Accessibility
Another great feature of AWS Quicksight is its great compatibility and access across multiple devices. Your Quicksight dashboards can quite seamlessly integrate into your own applications which enables you to access the dashboards without even signing into the AWS control panel.

#### 4. Data Alerts
While managing a business, tracking all your important metrics throughout the day is nearly impossible. AWS Quicksight’s data alerts come into handy in scenarios like these. Quicksight monitors your KPI’s for you and alerts you if a particular threshold is satisfied.
